\section{Timeline}

2008: Development of pandas started\\
2009: pandas becomes open source\\
2012: First edition of Python for Data Analysis is published\\
2015: pandas becomes a NumFOCUS sponsored project\\
2018: First in-person core developer sprint\\

\section{Library Highlights}

\begin{itemize}
\item A fast and efficient DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing

\item Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL databases, and the fast HDF5 format

\item Intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data: gain automatic label-based alignment in computations and easily manipulate messy data into an orderly form

\item Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets

\item Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets

\item Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for size mutability

\item Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets

\item High performance merging and joining of data sets

\item Hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure

\item Time series-functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging. Even create domain-specific time offsets and join time series without losing data

\item Highly optimized for performance, with critical code paths written in Cython or C

\item Python with pandas is in use in a wide variety of academic and commercial domains, including Finance, Neuroscience, Economics, Statistics, Advertising, Web Analytics, and more
\end{itemize}

\section{Mission}

pandas aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.

\section{Vision}

A world where data analytics and manipulation software is:

\begin{itemize}
\item Accessible to everyone
\item Free for users to use and modify
\item Flexible
\item Powerful
\item Easy to use
\item Fast
\end{itemize}
